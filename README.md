GNNFF [1] is a graph neural network framework to directly predict atomic forces from automatically extracted features of the local atomic environment that are translationally-invariant, but rotationally-covariant to the coordinate of the atoms.
This package is an atomistic force fields that constructed based on GNNFF.
